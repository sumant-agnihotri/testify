# TESTIFY

An app for teachers to make question banks and create tests for students. The students can then take the test and review their results.


## USER STORIES

### As a teacher:
- I should be able to login as a teacher (or signup, requires admin approval) 
- I should be able to view my question banks
- I should be able to create a new question bank
- I should be able to add questions to question bank(s)
  The above should include correct and dummy answers
- I should be able to rename the question bank
- I should be able to edit the question and/or its answers
- I should be able to view list of tests I have created
- I should be able to create a new test
- I should be able to add/remove questions to the test from my questuion bank
- I should be able to review student results for any student


The idea here is that a teacher can have multiple question banks (for different classes/subjects). And when creating a test they can choose which bank they want to use to create the test.



### As a student:
- I should be able to login as a student (or signup)
- I should be able to view list of tests and select the one I wish to attempt
- I should be able to submit my answer against each question
- At the end of the test, I should be able to view my score
- I should have a review screen where I can review my score against each test I have attempted so far
